TypiingTest was my final project in this introduction to object oriented programming. 

It is a simple yet capable typing tracker featuring several test modes and statistic collection.
The goal was to utilize object oriented principles including the four pillars, interfaces, and more while learning Java practices.

The standard test uses the 200 most common English words, but tests are limitless and can be configured using crazy words, stories, or any custom word set.

Following a test, your statistics are displayed:
<pre>
Time : elapsed time spent typing in seconds
Accuracy: percentage of correctly pressed keys
Raw(wpm): total amount of correct characters divided by 5, normalized to 60 seconds
WPM : raw value multiplied by accuracy value
</pre>
